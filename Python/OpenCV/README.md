# Display Resolution
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080i
- The "i" is an abbreviation for "interlaced"; this indicates that only the odd lines, then the even lines of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video.
- The "p" refers to progressive scan, which indicates that the lines of resolution for each frame are "drawn" on the screen in sequence.
## List of Common Resolutions

	- "4K" refers to a horizontal display resolution of approximately 4,000 pixels.
- 8K UHD-2 (8K Ultra HD 2): 7680 × 4320, 16:9, 33,177,600pixels
	- "8K" refers to a horizontal display resolution of approximately 8,000 pixels.

# AI Upscaling

- Traditional upscaling starts with a low-resolution image and tries to improve its visual quality at higher resolutions. ***AI upscaling takes a different approach: Given a low-resolution image, a deep learning model predicts a high-resolution image that would downscale to look like the original, low-resolution image.***

# Types of Display
## CRT (Cathode-Ray Tube)
- Source: https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-a-crt-monitor.htm
- A CRT (cathode-ray tube) monitor is an analog display device *that creates a visible image on the screen by directing three electron beams over millions of phosphor dots to make them light up. In a color monitor, the screen is composed of numerous stripes of alternating red, green, and blue phosphor dots, which get activated by the electrons and combine to make countless different hues.*
- The electron beam repetitively scans the entire front of the tube to “paint” and refresh the image nearly 100 times every second. Computer monitors and televisions that use CRT technology have large, heavy physical casings. *The long length between the front screen and the back of the case is necessary to accommodate the length of the vacuum tube.*
## LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)

- Instead of firing electrons at a glass screen, *an LCD has a backlight that provides light source to individual pixels arranged in a rectangular grid. Each pixel has a RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) sub-pixel that can be turned on or off. When all of a pixel’s sub-pixels are turned off, it appears black. When all the sub-pixels are turned on 100%, it appears white. By adjusting the individual levels of red, green, and blue light, millions of color combinations are obtained.*
## LED (Light-Emitting Diode)

# Rasterize
- Source: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/rasterize.htm
- *Rasterize is converting a vector image (a mathematically defined image of points and curves) to a raster image (a picture composed of discrete pixels).* More plainly, taking scene geometry and converting it to pixels for display on a screen or for printing purposes.

# Image File Formats
## JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)/JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format)
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_format#JPEG/JFIF
- JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a lossy compression method; JPEG-compressed images are usually stored in the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) file format. The JPEG/JFIF filename extension is JPG or JPEG. Nearly every digital camera can save images in the JPEG/JFIF format, *which supports eight-bit grayscale images and 24-bit color images (eight bits each for red, green, and blue). JPEG applies lossy compression to images, which can result in a significant reduction of the file size. Applications can determine the degree of compression to apply, and the amount of compression affects the visual quality of the result. When not too great, the compression does not noticeably affect or detract from the image's quality, but JPEG files suffer generational degradation when repeatedly edited and saved.*
## GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
- The GIF is in normal use limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors (while 24-bit color depth is technically possible). *GIF is most suitable for storing graphics with few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos, and cartoon style images, as it uses LZW lossless compression, which is more effective when large areas have a single color, and less effective for photographic or dithered images. Due to GIF's simplicity and age, it achieved almost universal software support. Due to its animation capabilities, it is still widely used to provide image animation effects, despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats.*
## PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- Compared to JPEG, PNG excels when the image has large, uniformly colored areas. Even for photographs – where JPEG is often the choice for final distribution since its compression technique typically yields smaller file sizes – *PNG is still well-suited to storing images during the editing process because of its lossless compression.*
