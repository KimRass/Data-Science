# Display Resolution
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080i
- The "i" is an abbreviation for "interlaced"; this indicates that only the odd lines, then the even lines of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video.
- The "p" refers to progressive scan, which indicates that the lines of resolution for each frame are "drawn" on the screen in sequence.

# AI Upscaling
- Source: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/02/03/what-is-ai-upscaling/
- Traditional upscaling starts with a low-resolution image and tries to improve its visual quality at higher resolutions. AI upscaling takes a different approach: Given a low-resolution image, a deep learning model predicts a high-resolution image that would downscale to look like the original, low-resolution image.
