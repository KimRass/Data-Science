# VPN(Virtual Private Network)
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network
- A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. The benefits of a VPN include increases in functionality, security, and management of the private network. It provides access to resources inaccessible on the public network and is typically used for telecommuting workers. Encryption is common, although not an inherent part of a VPN connection

- VPNs encrypt all the data you send over the internet.
	- When you’re connected to a VPN server, all your internet traffic is encrypted. This means that nobody can see what you’re doing online.
	- Encryption stops hackers from seeing sensitive information that you enter into websites, like your passwords. This is especially important if you’re using public WiFi because it’s easy for cybercriminals to monitor your connection on public networks. But a VPN makes sure that even if someone stole your data, they wouldn’t be able to decrypt it or even understand it.
- Your VPN also protects your privacy
	- Websites and services use your IP to determine your location. When you connect to a VPN server, your IP address won’t be visible. Because they can no longer see your real IP, they can’t see where you’re located.
