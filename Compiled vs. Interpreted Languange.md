# Compiled vs. Interpreted Language
- Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/
## Compliled Language
- A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters.
- In this language, once the program is compiled it is expressed in the instructions of the target machine.
- There are at least two steps to get from source code to execution.
- Compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs and deliver better performance.
- Compilation errors prevent the code from compiling.
- The code of compiled language can be executed directly by the computerâ€™s CPU
- Examples: C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.
## Interpreted Language
- An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.
- The instructions are not directly executed by the target machine.
- There is only one step to get from source code to execution.
- In this language, interpreted programs can be modified while the program is running.
- All the debugging occurs at run-time.
- A program written in an interpreted language is not compiled, it is interpreted.
- This language delivers relatively slower performance.
- Examples: JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.

## Compiled
- Compile is the process of turning code into machine instructions (or some kind of intermediate language, or bytecode, etc). A tool that does this is called a compiler.

- Compile is the creation of an executable program from code written in a compiled programming language. Compiling allows the computer to run and understand the program without the need of the programming software used to create it. When a program is compiled it is often compiled for a specific platform (e.g., IBM platform) that works with IBM compatible computers, but not other platforms (e.g., Apple platform).
## Compiler
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler
- In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.
## Debug
- Debug is the act of finding out where in the code the application is going wrong. (= Get rid of bugs)

# PyPy
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy
- PyPy is an alternative implementation of the Python programming language to CPython (which is the standard implementation). PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy uses a just-in-time compiler. Most Python code runs well on PyPy except for code that depends on CPython extensions, which either does not work or incurs some overhead when run in PyPy.
