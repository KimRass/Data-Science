- The parts where air is pushed closer together are called compressions, and the parts where it is pushed further apart are called rarefactions. Such waves that traverse space using compressions and rarefactions are called longitudinal waves.

# Fourier Transform
- We call this transformation moving from a time-domain representation to a frequency domain representation.
- A discrete Fourier transform is computationally quite heavy to calculate, with a time complexity of the order O(n^2). But there is a faster algorithm called Fast Fourier Transform (or FFT) that performs with a complexity of O(nlogn).
