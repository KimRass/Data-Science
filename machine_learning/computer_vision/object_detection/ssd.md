- SSD speeds up the process by eliminating the need for the region proposal network.
- SSD uses VGG16 to extract feature maps. Then it detects objects using the Conv4_3 layer. For illustration, we draw the Conv4_3 to be 8 × 8 spatially (it should be 38 × 38). For each cell (also called location), it makes 4 object predictions. 
- At first, we describe how SSD detects objects from a single layer. Actually, it uses multiple layers (multi-scale feature maps) to detect objects independently. As CNN reduces the spatial dimension gradually, the resolution of the feature maps also decrease. SSD uses lower resolution layers to detect larger scale objects. For example, the 4× 4 feature maps are used for larger scale object. 
- SSD adds 6 more auxiliary convolution layers after the VGG16. Five of them will be added for object detection. In three of those layers, we make 6 predictions instead of 4. In total, SSD makes 8732 predictions using 6 layers.

- The default boundary boxes are equivalent to anchors in Faster R-CNN. 
- Conceptually, the ground truth boundary boxes can be partitioned into clusters with each cluster represented by a default boundary box (the centroid of the cluster). So, instead of making random guesses, we can start the guesses based on those default boxes. 
- To keep the complexity low, the default boxes are pre-selected manually and carefully to cover a wide spectrum of real-life objects. 
- Now, instead of using global coordination for the box location, the boundary box predictions are relative to the default boundary boxes at each cell (∆cx, ∆cy, ∆w, ∆h), i.e. the offsets (difference) to the default box at each cell for its center (cx, cy), the width and the height. 
- For each feature map layers, it shares the same set of default boxes centered at the corresponding cell. But different layers use different sets of default boxes to customize object detections at different resolutions. The 4 green boxes below illustrate 4 default boundary boxes. 
- Default boundary boxes are chosen manually. SSD defines a scale value for each feature map layer. Starting from the left, Conv4_3 detects objects at the smallest scale 0.2 (or 0.1 sometimes), and then increases linearly to the rightmost layer at a scale of 0.9. Combining the scale value with the target aspect ratios, we compute the width and the height of the default boxes. For layers making 6 predictions, SSD starts with 5 target aspect ratios: 1, 2, 3, 1/2, and 1/3.
- Matching strategy 
    - SSD predictions are classified as positive matches or negative matches. SSD only uses positive matches in calculating the localization cost (the mismatch of the boundary box). If the corresponding default boundary box (not the predicted boundary box) has an IoU greater than 0.5 with the ground truth, the match is positive. Otherwise, it is negative.
    - Once we identify the positive matches, we use the corresponding predicted boundary boxes to calculate the cost. This matching strategy nicely partitions what shape of the ground truth that a prediction is responsible for.
    - This matching strategy encourages each prediction to predict shapes closer to the corresponding default box. Therefore our predictions are more diverse and more stable in the training.
