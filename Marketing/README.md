- MAU stands for monthly active user, ***it's the number of users that have done something meaningful in your product in the last 30 days/calendar month.***
- ***It’s up to you to determine what the definition of “active” means for your company; it could be visiting your website, logging into the app, viewing a post, or completing a specific event. The desired time period of measurement will vary across different industries and products. For instance, a bank wouldn’t expect their users to check their balance daily, but a social media company would anticipate this type of frequency.***
- ***MAU (Monthly Active Users) is considered a key performance indicator (KPI) for many businesses.*** MAU can tell you:
	- General health of a business
	- Success of a marketing campaign in attracting new users
	- Level of interest in a product or service
	- *Retention rate*
	- *Churn rate*
	- Growth rate and potential (particularly if you don’t have paid users yet)
	- Revenue growth and potential
- *Most importantly, MAU can indicate the perceived value of an app, service, or product.*
- ***You can use the calendar month or any 30-day period when calculating the monthly active users. Each unique user is counted only once, even if they are active numerous times throughout the day or month.***
### DAU/MAU
- These metrics can also be used to calculate the DAU/MAU ratio. Simply divide DAU by MAU to get the user ratio percentage. Example: If you have 1,000 daily users and 5,000 monthly users, the DAU/MAU ratio is 20%. ***The DAU/MAU ratio will tell you the rate of returning users (a.k.a. stickiness).*** A high rate suggests good engagement and perceived value, whereas a low rate indicates a lack of interest that requires further analysis.
## LTV (LifeTime Value)

# Power User

- ***Power users are the individuals that interact with your product the most when compared to other customers.*** The definition of a power user will vary by industry and company for example, a Finance company may define their power user as someone who logs in 2x a week, while a consumer tech app may expect their powers users to sign in multiple times a day.
- But power users are at their most impactful when they make their network your network. They are usually the first to sing your praises and leave a glowing review or recommend your business to their Twitter feed, family, or friends. Their enthusiasm becomes a powerful source of new business.
