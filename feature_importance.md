# Feature Importance
## Permutation Feature Importance
- Reference: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html
- Permutation feature importance is a model inspection technique that can be used for any fitted estimator when the data is tabular.
- Features that are important on the training set but not on the held-out set might cause the model to overfit.
- Tree-based models provide an alternative measure of feature importances based on the mean decrease in impurity (MDI). Impurity is quantified by the splitting criterion of the decision trees (Gini, Entropy or Mean Squared Error). However, this method can give high importance to features that may not be predictive on unseen data when the model is overfitting. Permutation-based feature importance, on the other hand, avoids this issue, since it can be computed on unseen data.
- Furthermore, impurity-based feature importance for trees are strongly biased and favor high cardinality features (typically numerical features) over low cardinality features such as binary features or categorical variables with a small number of possible categories.
- Permutation-based feature importances do not exhibit such a bias. Additionally, the permutation feature importance may be computed performance metric on the model predictions and can be used to analyze any model class (not just tree-based models).
- When two features are correlated and one of the features is permuted, the model will still have access to the feature through its correlated feature. This will result in a lower importance value for both features, where they might actually be important.
- One way to handle this is to cluster features that are correlated and only keep one feature from each cluster.

- Because this dataset contains multicollinear features, the permutation importance will show that none of the features are important. One approach to handling multicollinearity is by performing hierarchical clustering on the featuresâ€™ Spearman rank-order correlations, picking a threshold, and keeping a single feature from each cluster.
- The permutation importance plot shows that permuting a feature drops the accuracy by at most 0.012, which would suggest that none of the features are important.
- When features are collinear, permutating one feature will have little effect on the models performance because it can get the same information from a correlated feature. One way to handle multicollinear features is by performing hierarchical clustering on the Spearman rank-order correlations, picking a threshold, and keeping a single feature from each cluster.

- We will show that the impurity-based feature importance can inflate the importance of numerical features.
- Furthermore, the impurity-based feature importance of random forests suffers from being computed on statistics derived from the training dataset: the importances can be high even for features that are not predictive of the target variable, as long as the model has the capacity to use them to overfit.
- random_num is a high cardinality numerical variable (as many unique values as records).
random_cat is a low cardinality categorical variable (3 possible values).
The impurity-based feature importance ranks the numerical features to be the most important features. As a result, the non-predictive random_num variable is ranked the most important!
This problem stems from two limitations of impurity-based feature importances:
impurity-based importances are biased towards high cardinality features;
impurity-based importances are computed on training set statistics and therefore do not reflect the ability of feature to be useful to make predictions that generalize to the test set (when the model has enough capacity).
- It is also possible to compute the permutation importances on the training set. This reveals that random_num gets a significantly higher importance ranking than when computed on the test set. The difference between those two plots is a confirmation that the RF model has enough capacity to use that random numerical feature to overfit. You can further confirm this by re-running this example with constrained RF with min_samples_leaf=10.
- Reference: https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/feature-importance.html#feature-importance-data
- We measure the importance of a feature by calculating the increase in the model's prediction error after permuting the feature. A feature is "important" if shuffling its values increases the model error, because in this case the model relied on the feature for the prediction. A feature is "unimportant" if shuffling its values leaves the model error unchanged, because in this case the model ignored the feature for the prediction.
- If you want a more accurate estimate, you can estimate the error of permuting feature j by pairing each instance with the value of feature j of each other instance (except with itself). This gives you a dataset of size n(n-1) to estimate the permutation error, and it takes a large amount of computation time. I can only recommend using the n(n-1) method if you are serious about getting extremely accurate estimates.
- **The feature importance based on training data makes us mistakenly believe that features are important for the predictions, when in reality the model was just overfitting and the features were not important at all.**
- Feature importance based on the training data tells us which features are important for the model in the sense that it depends on them for making predictions.
- If you would use (nested) cross-validation for the feature importance estimation, you would have the problem that the feature importance is not calculated on the final model with all the data, but on models with subsets of the data that might behave differently.
-  **You need to decide whether you want to know how much the model relies on each feature for making predictions (-> training data) or how much the feature contributes to the performance of the model on unseen data (-> test data).**
