# KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
## DAU (Daily Active Users), WAU (Weekly Active Users), MAU (Monthly Active Users)
- Source: https://mixpanel.com/blog/mau/
- MAU stands for monthly active user, ***it's the number of users that have done something meaningful in your product in the last 30 days/calendar month.***
- ***It’s up to you to determine what the definition of “active” means for your company; it could be visiting your website, logging into the app, viewing a post, or completing a specific event. The desired time period of measurement will vary across different industries and products. For instance, a bank wouldn’t expect their users to check their balance daily, but a social media company would anticipate this type of frequency.***
- ***MAU (Monthly Active Users) is considered a key performance indicator (KPI) for many businesses.*** MAU can tell you:
	- General health of a business
	- Success of a marketing campaign in attracting new users
	- Level of interest in a product or service
	- *Retention rate*
	- *Churn rate*
	- Growth rate and potential (particularly if you don’t have paid users yet)
	- Revenue growth and potential
- *Most importantly, MAU can indicate the perceived value of an app, service, or product.*
- ***You can use the calendar month or any 30-day period when calculating the monthly active users. Each unique user is counted only once, even if they are active numerous times throughout the day or month.***
### DAU/MAU
- These metrics can also be used to calculate the DAU/MAU ratio. Simply divide DAU by MAU to get the user ratio percentage. Example: If you have 1,000 daily users and 5,000 monthly users, the DAU/MAU ratio is 20%. ***The DAU/MAU ratio will tell you the rate of returning users (a.k.a. stickiness).*** A high rate suggests good engagement and perceived value, whereas a low rate indicates a lack of interest that requires further analysis.
## LTV (LifeTime Value)

# Power User

- ***Power users are the individuals that interact with your product the most when compared to other customers.*** The definition of a power user will vary by industry and company for example, a Finance company may define their power user as someone who logs in 2x a week, while a consumer tech app may expect their powers users to sign in multiple times a day.
- But power users are at their most impactful when they make their network your network. They are usually the first to sing your praises and leave a glowing review or recommend your business to their Twitter feed, family, or friends. Their enthusiasm becomes a powerful source of new business.

# Agile

- Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. *Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.*
- *Open communication, collaboration, adaptation, and trust amongst team members are at the heart of agile.*

# ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP) refers to a type of software that organizations use to manage day-to-day business activities such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management and compliance, and supply chain operations.
- ERP systems tie together a multitude of business processes and enable the flow of data between them. By collecting an organization’s shared transactional data from multiple sources, ERP systems eliminate data duplication and provide data integrity with a single source of truth.

# CRM (Customer Relationship 
- Source: https://www.salesforce.com/ap/crm/what-is-crm/
- ***Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers.***
- *A CRM solution helps you focus on your organization’s relationships with individual people* — including customers, service users, colleagues, or suppliers — throughout your lifecycle with them, including finding new customers, winning their business, and providing support and additional services throughout the relationship.
- ***Everyone in your company can see how customers have been communicated with, what they’ve bought, when they last purchased, what they paid, and so much more.***
- Though CRM systems have traditionally been used as sales and marketing tools, ***customer service teams are seeing great benefits in using them. Today’s customer might raise an issue in one channel — say, Twitter — and then switch to email or telephone to resolve it in private. A CRM platform lets you manage the inquiry across channels without losing track, and gives sales, service, and marketing a single view of the customer.***
- ***Your customers may be contacting you on a range of different platforms including phone, email, or social media — asking questions, following up on orders, or contacting you about an issue. Without a common platform for customer interactions, communications can be missed or lost in the flood of information — leading to a slow or unsatisfactory response.***

# Sales

- *Sales refers to all activities involved in selling a product or service to a consumer or business.*
- *The goal is to reach out to leads who have shown interest in or fit the description of the company’s target customer, in hopes of providing them with a solution that results in a purchase of your product or service.*

# Commerce
- The activity of buying and selling, especially on a large scale.
## Marketing

- ***Marketing is the process of intentionally stimulating demand for and purchases of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging to be more attractive to buyers; selection of the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand.*** Marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency.

# Wireframe & Storyboard
## Wireframe

- ![image]( https://balsamiq.com/assets/learn/articles/all-controls-split-r.png)
- A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.
- Doing this work now, before any code is written and before the visual design is finalized, will save you lots of time and painful adjustment work later.
- Wireframes make it clear that no code has been written yet. If your customer or stakeholder received some screens that looked like screenshots of the final app, instead of a wireframe, they might assume that all the code behind those screenshots had already been written. This is most often not the case. Wireframes don't have this danger.

- Wireframe is a page schematic, a sketch of your website before any kind of development or design element goes into it. It is basically a visual representation of the layout of your website without the fancy elements such as colors, fonts, shading, or just any other design element that makes your website visually appealing and interactive.
- A wireframe is a linear representation of a website or web page structure, kind of a mock up screen of what the actual thing will look like.
## Storyboard
- 요청하는 고객이 작성해야만 하며 기획자가 대신 작성해주지 못함.
- 버전 이력 관리가 필요.
- 사용자 화면과 관리자 화면이 모두 있어야 함.

- Storyboard is kind of advanced wireframing created on a piece of paper using a pencil or using a graphics program on a computer.
- A storyboard is a more detailed representation, a high level outline including descriptions of what happens as user goes further inside the application. Storyboards are more dynamic in structure in terms of grouping and ordering.

# MOU (Memorandum Of Understanding)
- Source: https://legalvision.com.au/memorandum-of-understanding/
- *A memorandum of understanding (MOU) falls somewhere between a written contract and a handshake deal. It is a preliminary written agreement, outlining the framework or key terms they will later include in a formal contract.* An MOU is a useful tool because it helps ensure all parties are on the same page. Generally speaking, the document is not legally binding. However, if its content resembles that of a contract, it may be legally binding and therefore enforceable.
- *An MOU is often used in commercial partnerships to establish mutual goals and expectations. It sets out the rights and obligations of each party, which they incorporate into a formal contract at a later date.*
